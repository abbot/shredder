This repository contains small piecies of code with unproven usefulness.
Use at your own risk.

Bits and pieces:

 - `98-pidgin.sh` + `pidgin-netstatus.py`: place this into
   `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d`.
 - `geolocate.py`: convert an address to lattitude and longitude, in
   decimal and Garmin format.
 - `ipod_echo_fixer.py`: find all tracks by "Эхо Москвы", convert
   dates in names from dd.mm.yyyy to yyyy.mm.dd.
 - `mexmat_downloader.py`: use this to download books from
   lib.mexmat.ru.
 - `nss-import-certs.sh`: quick import
   `/etc/grid-security/certificates` contents to any NSS database
   (Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, Google Chrome, etc.)
 - `pm/power.d/49-hdd-power`: this was useful in `/etc/pm/power.d`
   some time ago to prevent unexpected Load_Cycle_Count (193) growth.
 - `pdf/two-docs-page-by-page.sh`: script to convert two PostScript
   (or PDF) A4 documents into one, with pages from one document on the
   left side and pages from another on the right side of a landscape
   scaled-down page.
